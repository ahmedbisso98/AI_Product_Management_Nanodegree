# AI_Product_Management_Nanodegree
Built familiarity and fluency with common AI concepts. Learned how to evaluate the business value of an AI product, train a model, and evaluate its business impact.

I worked on these 3 projects:

## Creating Dataset:

Designed a data annotation job to transform unstructured, unlabeled data, to a desired, labeled output that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images using Figure Eight's platform and a Kaggle chest x-ray dataset.

## Build a Model:
Built a classification model that acts as a diagnostic aid for doctors to help them quickly identify cases of pneumonia using Google's AutoML Vision Platform.

## Measuring Impact and Updating Models

Developed a business proposal for an AI product:
>- Business goal.
>- Success metrics.
>- Data, model.
>- MVP.
>- Post-MVP deployment.
